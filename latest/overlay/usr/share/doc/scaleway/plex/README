# Plex setup tutorial

## Connect to your server

Using ssh, connect to your server:
  ```ssh -L 32400:localhost:32400 root@server_ip```

## Configure your S3

  In order to configure your S3, you will need to create a new token at:
  https://cloud.scaleway.com/#/credentials

  After that, launch the configuration script and enter asked informations:

  ---------------- 

  scw-configure-s3

## Access your plex instance!

  Plex initial setup can only be configured on local, you can access at
    http://localhost:32400/web/
  
  After having plex set up, your instance can be found at 
    http://server_ip:32400/
  
  Once plex is set up, you can disconnect your ssh session.

  If you wish to make this index disapear and access your plex directly by your server's IP, enter, as root:

  ----------------

  mv /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf.sample /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

  systemctl restart apache2
